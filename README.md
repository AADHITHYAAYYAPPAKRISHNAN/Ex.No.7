## 🎯 Objectives
- To explore the principles of prompt engineering and their applications in AI tools.  
- To design an intelligent assistant that can handle personalized tasks and schedules.  
- To develop a natural conversation system that interacts through user-defined prompts.  
- To analyze how structured prompts can enhance task management and automation.  
- To implement creativity and critical thinking using LLMs for daily productivity.

## 🧩 Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed human–computer interaction with the rise of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.  
These models can process, understand, and generate text similar to human reasoning.  

A **prompt-based application** uses these models to perform meaningful tasks—like scheduling, summarizing, or answering questions—by simply structuring the right prompt, eliminating the need for complex programming.  

In this experiment, we design a **Personal Productivity Assistant** using ChatGPT prompts that can plan, organize, and manage tasks while adapting to user preferences.  

---

## 🧠 Aim
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT that can organize personal tasks, schedule reminders, and suggest wellness tips — demonstrating the transition from simple prompt designs to advanced interactive outputs.

---

## ⚙️ AI Tools Required
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5 or equivalent LLM)**  
- **Python / Flask** *(optional – for user interface)*  
- **Google Sheets / Notion** *(for data tracking, optional)*  
- **Command-line / Chat Interface** *(for simulation and testing)*  

---

## 📘 Explanation
Prompt-based systems rely on the **clarity, context, and structure** of instructions given to the model.  
A vague prompt gives a generic answer, but a detailed one produces structured and actionable results.

In this lab, ChatGPT functions as:
1. 🗂 **Task Organizer** – manages daily to-do lists and reminders.  
2. 🕒 **Time Planner** – schedules activities and identifies free slots.  
3. 💡 **Wellness Advisor** – provides personalized health and focus tips.  
4. 🔁 **Adaptive Learner** – modifies behavior based on user feedback.  

The experiment showcases how prompt complexity directly affects AI output quality and adaptability.

---

## 🧭 Procedure
1. Define the goals and tasks the assistant should perform.  
2. Construct prompts for each specific functionality (task, reminder, wellness).  
3. Interact with ChatGPT through command-line or chat interface.  
4. Modify and refine prompts to achieve better outputs.  
5. (Optional) Store user preferences to simulate adaptive learning.

## 💬 Prompt Design and Outputs

### 🔹 Prompt 1 – Basic Prompt
**Prompt:**  
> “List three productive activities I can do today.”

**Output:**  
1. Review your project notes.  
2. Organize your upcoming assignments.  
3. Spend 30 minutes reading a technical article.  

---

### 🔹 Prompt 2 – Intermediate Prompt
**Prompt:**  
> “Create a personal task planner that allows me to add or remove activities and sort them by importance.”

**Output:**  
- Add Task: “Add meeting preparation to High Priority.”  
- Remove Task: “Remove cleaning from task list.”  
- Priority Levels: High / Medium / Low.  
- Summary: “You have 2 High Priority tasks left for today.”  

---

### 🔹 Prompt 3 – Advanced Prompt
**Prompt:**  
> “Build an intelligent productivity assistant that manages my schedule, sets reminders, gives health tips, and learns from my habits.”

**Output:**  
**Personal AI Assistant Capabilities:**  
- **Task Manager:** Add, delete, and view tasks using natural language.  
  - Example: “Remind me to attend the webinar at 4 PM.”  
- **Smart Scheduler:** Identifies free time and prevents overlapping events.  
  - Example: “Your 4 PM meeting conflicts with class. Reschedule to 5 PM?”  
- **Health Monitor:** Offers wellness reminders.  
  - Example: “You’ve been sitting for 2 hours. Stretch your legs!”  
- **Preference Learner:** Adjusts to user routines.  
  - Example: “You usually study at night. Shall I remind you at 8 PM?”

## 🧑‍💻 Sample Simulation

**User:**  
> Add "Submit lab record" at 3 PM.  
**Assistant:**  
> Task added: "Submit lab record" scheduled for 3 PM.  

**User:**  
> Show all tasks for today.  
**Assistant:**  
> Tasks: Submit lab record (3 PM), Prepare slides (5 PM), Take a walk (8 PM).  

**User:**  
> Give me a wellness suggestion.  
**Assistant:**  
> “Drink water and take a 2-minute stretch break.”  

**User:**  
> What’s my evening plan?  
**Assistant:**  
> “At 5 PM – Prepare slides, at 8 PM – Take a walk.”

## 🔍 Observation
| Prompt Type | Behavior | Improvement |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Basic Prompt** | Simple task listing | No prioritization or scheduling |
| **Intermediate Prompt** | Adds/removes tasks, includes priorities | Basic reminders |
| **Advanced Prompt** | Adapts to user preferences, detects overlaps | Personalized, context-aware assistance |

---

## 📊 Expected Output

| **Feature** | **Description** | **Example Output** |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Task Organizer** | Add and track activities | “Added: Attend meeting at 10 AM.” |
| **Smart Planner** | Detects schedule conflicts | “Your 5 PM slot is busy. Suggest 6 PM instead.” |
| **Wellness Advisor** | Generates health tips | “Rest your eyes for 5 minutes.” |
| **Adaptive Learning** | Learns user routines | “You prefer morning study — remind at 9 AM?” |

---

##  Result
The experiment successfully demonstrated how **prompt engineering** can be applied to develop adaptive, interactive AI applications.  

Students were able to:  
- Design structured prompts for optimized AI responses.  
- Simulate a real-world personal productivity assistant.
